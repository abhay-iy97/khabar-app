 ## News app
[Abhay](https://github.com/abhay-iy97):

**Phase 1**:   
POC skeletal app which can scrape data and make it look decent first.  
Develop:
- Fluid UI.
- Scrape script.
- News tiles (from a data perspective: techniques to create this?)
- Visualization? (This is really vague atm. Vashisht & Pawan to elucidate)
  

**Phase 2**:   
Look into increasing the scope of scraping and check the feasiblity of that - possible roadblocks.   
Additional features: 
  - Basic game. Perhaps, sudoku or any other brain teasers.
  - Collation of free news sources like a newsstand.  
  - Multi doc summarization. Click on the summary which should direct you to the list of related articles. From this point, the user gets to choose the article they wants to read.
  - Multi-purpose. Content creation? 
  - Speech to text for news articles and summaries (eventually polyglot)
  - Sentiment analysis on news articles but what more can we do other than categorizing them? 
  - Bias elimination

**Phase 3**:
Audio segmentation on podcasts. 


## Tasks  
1. Collect keywords(trends) from twitter.   
2. Scrape opensource websites using keywords.   
3. Apply 15 min window on data with sorting according to no of articles.   
4. Store the links on GDrive?   
5. Display links in a basic ui on app.   
6. Use api for text to speech on the articles.
